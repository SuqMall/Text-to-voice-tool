Objective:
Create an Image Converter Tool for my Multi Tool Hub website. The tool should allow users to upload an image, choose an output format, and download the converted image while also displaying a preview of the output.

Functional Requirements:
Image Upload:

Users should be able to upload an image using a file input field.
Supported input formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, and WEBP.
Format Selection:

Provide a dropdown or button-based selection for output formats such as PNG, JPG, JPEG, PDF, BMP, GIF, WEBP, and TIFF.
Processing Status:

Once a user selects a format and clicks the "Convert" button, a loading indicator or "Processing image..." message should appear.
Output Preview & Download:

After the conversion is complete, display a preview of the converted image.
Provide a download button to save the converted image.
User-Friendly Interface:

Use a clean and modern UI with a dark theme to match the Multi Tool Hub website.
Ensure proper error handling (e.g., unsupported file types, file too large).
Technical Requirements:
Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
Implement JavaScript (or a suitable library like Canvas API) for image conversion.
Ensure the tool is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Expected Deliverables:
Complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
Fully functional image upload, conversion, and download features.
A visually appealing and easy-to-use user interface.
